## 4. Lazy Evaluation Iterator

Create a custom Rust iterator that:
- Lazily performs computations on each item of a collection.
- Supports filtering and mapping operations.

### Constraints:
- Ensure the iterator performs calculations only when needed.
- Make the iterator methods chainable for ease of use.
