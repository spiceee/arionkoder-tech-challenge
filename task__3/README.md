## 3. Trait-based Class Registration

Create a Rust application that:
- Defines a trait representing a common behavior or API contract.
- Registers multiple structs implementing this trait in a global registry.

Constraints:
- Ensure that the registration happens automatically upon initialization.
- Provide clear runtime checks if structs do not correctly implement required methods.
